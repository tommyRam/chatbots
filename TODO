tomorrow: 
  Refactoring
  front: scrolling up on new messages / add chat message header to make choices between rag technics
  backend: check expiration token in the backend not working well

  Bugs: - When error on login
        - Display directly the human message after the submit.


- Frontend:
    - route management
    - chatting and send factual data for response evaluations (AI as judge)
    - Choose the rag-endpoint
    - Design:
        - Sidebar (chat list, search from chat)
        - Chat section
        - Documents sections: (showing documents with metadata, showing documents in the selected documents directly)
    - automatically refresh access_token

- Backend:
  - endpoint for evaluation (AI as a judge)
  - add another RAG techniques
  - Manage memory for agentic RAG
  - delete chat (delete document from drive, from pinecone and then from database)
  - add testing

- Deployment:

  - Dockerize backend
  - deploy frontend into vercel
  - apply ci/cd

- Database:

  - Migrate into postgres
  - In prod drive may be changed into (aws s3, google cloud storage, ...)
