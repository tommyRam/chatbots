       "'The writer of the essay is **Paul Graham**.\\n\\nThe essay, titled \"Be Good,\" discusses the concept of \"being good\" or \"benevolence\" not merely as a moral imperative, but as a powerful and effective strategy. Paul Graham argues that benevolence is a fundamental force that can lead to success, even in areas like business and technology. He suggests that:\\n\\n*   **Benevolence is a powerful force:** It\\'s something one would be foolish to bet against, akin to a fundamental principle.\\n*   **It provides a sense of mission:** Doing good for people can give a sense of purpose that makes individuals more resilient and dedicated.\\n*   **It attracts help from others:** Being good makes other people want to assist you, which is described as an inborn human trait.\\n*   **It\\'s a practical strategy:** Graham emphasizes that he is not advocating for goodness in a sanctimonious way, but because \"it works.\" He suggests it can serve as a guide for strategy and even a design specification for software, citing examples like Google and early Microsoft.\\n\\nIn essence, the essay explores the practical advantages and strategic benefits of adopting a benevolent approach, asserting that it is a highly effective way to operate.'"
